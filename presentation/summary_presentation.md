## Introduction

### DNA

Cells are the basic unit of life that are regulated by genes, which are sections of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence that encodes information for building and regulating cells. DNA is a polymerase of nucleotides, which are monomers composed with deoxyribose sugar, nitrogenous base and one of four phosphate groups, desinated adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). The nucleotides forms strand, and thereby the genetic information is encoded through the arrangement of nucleotides with different types of phosphate group.

### Epigenetics and DNA methylation

Since the information carried by DNA need to be transform to other biological functional groups that can be further utilized by the cells to be expressed, and therefore some chemical modifications on DNA influence gene expression without altering the DNA sequence. Such modifications of DNA that does not change are called epigenetic modifications and DNA methylation is an important form of epigenetic modification.

During a DNA methylation event, methyl groups are attached to the DNA, primarily on cytosine nucleotide (C) that are side-by-side with guanine (G) nucleotides. In such case, methylation is said to occur at CpG sites, where p refers to the phosphoryl group connecting C and G.

The current golden stanadard of measuring methylation is bisulfite conversion, where unmethylated cytosines are converted to uracil without altering unmethylated cytosine, which enable methylation sites to be identified. Such method offers resolution of methylation to the single CpG site, and thereby for for given DNA sample from a cell, one can identify whether methylation occurs on a specific CpG site. For a single CpG site in of a DNA sample, it can either be methylated or not and therefore a binary data is produced,but one can give continous estimation of the methylation level of a CpG site using multiple DNA samples by calculating the proportion of methylied samples among total samples.

### differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and bumphunting

The disribution of nucleotide types are differnet across the DNA and in some regions the density of CpG sites are higher than others, and such regions are known as CpG islands. The presence of CpG islands makes methylation level highly correlated and therefore it's natural to investigate the methylation level of DNA at different genome regions consist of multiple CpG sites that are physically close to each other.

DNA methlation plays essential role in regulating gene expression and it has been found that the change in the methylation pattern is associate with cancer development. To futher characterize the methylation pattern of cancer tissues, one need to identify and the genome regions that are differently methylated among samples from normal and cancer tissues, and such regions are know as differentially methylated regions (DMRs).
